 * and uses the "wallclock"/PDT timeline as a cross-reference to `details`, adjusting the presentation
 * times/timelines of `details` accordingly.
 * Given the asynchronous nature of fetches and initial loads of live `main` and audio/subtitle tracks,
 * the primary purpose of this function is to ensure the "local timelines" of audio/subtitle tracks
 * are aligned to the main/video timeline, using PDT as the cross-reference/"anchor" that should
 * be consistent across playlists, per the HLS spec.
 * @param details - The details of the rendition you'd like to time-align (e.g. an audio rendition).
 * @param refDetails - The details of the reference rendition with start and PDT times for alignment.
